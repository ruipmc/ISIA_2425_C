The project aims to design a decentralized multi-agent system using SPADE to improve coordination during disaster relief efforts. The system will involve various agents, such as emergency responders, supply vehicles, shelters, and civilians, working together to ensure efficient resource allocation and assistance delivery. Unlike traditional centralized systems, which often struggle with challenges like communication breakdowns and changing conditions, this decentralized approach allows agents to respond more effectively and flexibly to evolving situations.
